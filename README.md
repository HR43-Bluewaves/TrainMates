# OVERVIEW
   CEO Helen and CMO Henry proposed an application called "Train Me, Mate", which comprises a recreational match making app between trainers and trainees. This

   project was a brief 2-week sprint where our team implemented a product vision focused on its core functionality and stripped of any other auxillery features.

   Focusing on the elimination of waste, we got rid of any work bringing no value to the end product. This helped us to quickly evaluate the potential product

   acceptance by the market by gathering the valuable feedback from Helen and Henry. The minimal functional scope must be just sufficient to deploy the product and

   deliver it to the early users as soon as possible.

# DESCRIPTION
  "Train Me, Mate" will be a dynamically rendered web application that will keep user experience easy to understand. The user interface will give the user a modern

  design with simple navigation to trainers and classes and account settings. The goal for this application is to create a user friendly platform where users can

  virtually and physically interact with aesthetic personal trainers. We strive to focus on Simplicity, Service, and Affordability. Features implemented will be

  constrained to the client experience which enables customers to search and browse for trainers, courses, book session, and message trainers and friends. The

  purpose of this application is to help our community stay healthy and motivated for their well being.

# MVP

    The landing page captures the first impression of all customers. As such, the landing page encompasses a simple, yet sleek design with a captivating company logo

    and slogan, accompanied by a relevant background. The navigation bar will lead users to sign up or login. The sign up and login page will be a simple user form

    to fill out the necessary information containing full name, email address, address, phone number, and validation.Future enhancements: If time allows, additional

    content will be displayed to hear the company's mission statement and achievements.

  2: Home page
    To keep user experience simple but efficient, the user home page will have a dashboard composed of upcoming classes, promotions, and recommended classes. At the

    top of the page there will be a navigation bar with a filtered search funtionality, a simple directory to trainers and classes, checkout icon, messaging icon,

    notifications, and user information. The navigation bar will be displayed at the top of each page for easy accessebility.

  3: Trainer and Trainee Profiles
    The trainer and trainee catalogue will be composed of simple panels that display the name. By selecting on the panels, it will direct the user to the full

    information of the related profile and product.

    The full profile will contain the following information: name/class, geographical location, bio/slogan, expertise, ratings, and reviews. The profile will contain

    a list of reviews for the individual trainers, trainees and courses along with relevant sorting features.

    If a trainer is signed and authenticated, they will have the ability to add a class.

  4: Booking sessions
